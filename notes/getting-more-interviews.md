## How To Get More Interviews

Completing all of the following should take at most, a week

### Resume

> Only good to get my foot in the door, don't lie, but don't sell myself short

Choose the company I want and tailor my resume to that company, that role.

#### Resume Guidelines

1. One-page

2. Relevant skills/keywords

   - include words from job descriptions: job title and skills required(only add years, if it is 3years+)

   - For work experience, make position bolder than company and in summary, state meaningful work that will stand out for that position

   - Remove I, rather say Developed this, than say I developed this

   - Use action words: what I did and what value did it create/what did it result into. Use numbers as much as possible, where applicable.

   - Include only sections that are related to the job. e.g: Education, Projects, Experience, technical Skills, etc

   - [ ] Add courses completed in ZTM under education

3. Personalized: unique to each role I'm applying to

   - Include company name and position applying to
   - In every section, list skills/keywords required/particular to the job

4. Online links: GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio etc.

5. Soft-skills: communication sills, scheduling, time management, analytical thinking, flexibility, ability to work independently
