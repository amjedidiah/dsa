# Offer + Negotiation

## Handling Rejection

- Ask for feedback, that I am constantly learning and need the feedback to be better

## Negotiation 101

### What Salary Do You Want/ What Are Your Salary Expectations?

I know the average salary for a Silicon valley engineer is $90,000/yr.
We can start from there

### Give reason for everything

For instance if I get an offer I don't like,:

- I could ask for time to discuss this over with family as I support my family OR
- Considering my responsibilities, family and otherwise, I would need to take on a second job to cope. And because I want just to foucus on one job, I would like to humbly decline.

> Always thank for the generous offer, before giving my reasons for renegotition or rejection

### Always negotiate

### Be positive

- It is a win-win situation for both parties

### Have Stakes

- Show companies that you have other options

## Handling An Offer

    - Don't be quick to accept.
        Thank them for the offer and let them know you enjoyed the interview and will very much liek to work for them. However, I will need time to give a good response, as I am interviewing at other companies and need some time to determine if this is the best offer right now, even though I enjoyed the interview process and will very much like to work for their company

    - Be positive
    - Ask for time
    - Let other companies I am interviewing at know I have an offer with a timeline to give feedback back on and will like to know what their own stand is

### ToDo

- At least $60,000/yr
- What value do I provide to the company?
- Start from higher

## Handling Multiple Offers

1. Is there any one of these offers I feel I am under qualified for?
   - This is the one to go for
2. Long-term growth potential(skills and position)
   - This is the one to go for
3. Will I respect people arund me, am I going to learn from my co-workers?
   - This is the one to go for
4. Salary and benefits
   - This is the one to go for
5. Is my decision based on desperation?
   - Never accept an offer based on desperation

> Never burn down bridges

## Getting A Raise

> Stay valuable, complete work on time with good quality

- Plan my career path before I start
- Ask for a raise
- Show why I need a raise. Don't tell:
  -- Keep a documented record of improvement in skill level
  -- Keep a record of my performance in the past, key contributions and achievements
