# Notes

## Definition

Data structures are collection of values that are organized in a way that allows you to access and manipulate them.

Algorithms are the ways to manipulate data structures.

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

## Data Storage

- 8 bits = 1 byte = 3 octals
- 32 bits = 4 bytes = 11 octals = 1 word
- A string takes up `1 byte` of storage for each character in the string.
- An integer takes up `1 word` of storage.
- A decimal number takes up `1 or 2 word(s)` depending on how it is stored.

## Operations on Data Structures

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal: access each data item for processing, and possibly more than once.
- Searching: find the location of a dat item, if it exists
- Sorting
- Access
